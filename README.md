=================

Example project showing how to use Bakehouse.

Take a look at:
 * [`index.jsp`](https://github.com/martypitt/bakehouse-example/blob/master/WebContent/index.jsp) to see how resources are declared,  
 * [`applicationContext.xml`](https://github.com/martypitt/bakehouse-example/blob/master/WebContent/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml) to see how to wire up Spring
 * [`ExampleBakehouseConfig.java`](https://github.com/martypitt/bakehouse-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mangofactory/bakehouse/example/ExampleBakehouseConfig.java) to see a sample configuration

Spend some time at [Bakehouse](http://martypitt.github.com/bakehouse) to get a gist of what Bakehouse is, and then let me know that you're interested in the project by either [starring it]('https://github.com/martypitt/bakehouse') or [leaving me a comment](https://github.com/martypitt/bakehouse/issues/4)
